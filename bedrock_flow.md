Phase1 ,Core Concept
1. Logic (Mendelson/Enderton),
    Rules of Reasoning,"This defines the ""why people accept a proof."" Without it, every mathematical statement is just an assertion. We must master the process of proving first."
2. Set Theory (Suppes/Halmos),
    Building Blocks (Axioms),"Once we have the rules, we need the starting truths (the ZFC axioms) to build objects. Set theory defines what 0, 1, and even an ""ordered pair"" are."
3. Construction (Rudin/Tao),
    The Objects Themselves,"Only after defining the rules (Logic) and the foundational starting points (Sets) can we formally construct the number systems (N,Z,Q,R)."

This sequence is mandatory if we want to ensure no future concepts are involved in lower paths. We cannot rigorously define a Set without the concept of a Logical Axiom, and we cannot rigorously define the number 2 without the concept of a Set.
