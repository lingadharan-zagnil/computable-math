Tautologies

Truth function - A function that takes truth values from input statements and outputs a truth value following a fixed rule. As we know this also only cares about the truth value of the statement.

As per book1 
    A truth function of n arguments is defined to be a function of n arguments, the
    arguments and values of which are the truth values T or F. 

    Statement letter -> Already seen, letters getting replaced with statement that cannot be broken further, also called atomic sentences or statements.
    Statement form -> Statement letters and propositional connectives together gives us statement form.
    A statement form that is always true, no matter what the truth values of its
    statement letters may be, is called a tautology. 

    A statement form is a tautology if and only if its corresponding truth function takes only the value T,
    or equivalently, if, in its truth table, the column under the statement form
    contains only Ts

    Statement form here is said to be tautology
        Tautology means - True under all interpretations or a statement that never be false.

        So regarding the statement form, for the all possible truth values of statement letters of the statement form, the outputs stays true no matter.
Law of excluded middle - For any statement P, P is either true of false, but cannot be third or stays in the middle.The middle possibility is excluded between true, false.
